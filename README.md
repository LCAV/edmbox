# EDMbox

This repository contains a collection of Matlab routines to accompany the paper
_Euclidean Distance Matrices: A Short Walk Through Theory, Algorithms and Applications_ by Ivan
Dokmanic, Reza Parhizkar, Juri Ranieri and Martin Vetterli.

## Main functions

## Helper functions

| Filename          | Description                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------         |
| cubicfcnroots.m   | Roots of a cubic polynomial |
| quadfcn.m         | Roots of a quadratic        |

## Examples and paper figures

| Filename                       | Description                            |
| -----------------              | -------------------                    |
| Example1_SwissTrains_SBB.m     | City locations in the Swiss trains box |
| Example2_RandomCompletion.m    | Generates Fig. 6 of the paper          |
| Example3_UnfoldingCompletion.m | Generates Fig. 7 of the paper          |

__NOTE__: Example2 and Example3 are outdated (they correspond to version 1 of the paper which was superseded by a revised version). We will commit the new routines in the coming days.
